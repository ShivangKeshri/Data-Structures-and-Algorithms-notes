# Instant-Vector-Search-Using-Hypermode-and-Modus
This is an app on how to make an instant vector search app(with database) using Modus and Hypermode. I have made this in preparation of the Hypermode Knowledge Graph + AI Hackathon on Devpost. This is just a practice project to gain familiarity with Vector Databases, and instant Vector searches.
